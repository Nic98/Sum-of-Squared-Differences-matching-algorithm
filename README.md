### Note
1. Because it is very time consuming to run all of our functions in their entirety, most of the data you see in the report is based on operations with a window of size 20. The results of our operations on a window of size 50 are recorded in Result1.png in the zip archive.
2. The main function is the main file that runs our methods and in it you can see how the functions we have designed will run. In addition to this, you are free to adjust a number of parameters such as the window size, the details of how to do this are documented at the bottom of the README.
3. As mentioned above, since the program runs too long, we predict the run time by our algorithm on each image by using the tqdm module. In addition, we also apply it to check the performance of the algorithm after we accelerated the process.
4. There are a few pictrues in the zip file, they are the screenshot of our result. Since we are not using Jupyternotebook to wirte our code this time, please use these images to verify our program.
### Functions
#### main.py
main.py is the main file to run our program. You can find how we import and transform the input image. Besides, all the functions that are used to display the final result are put into this file. You can simply run the program and get the same result as what is shown in the Result1.png.
#### smoothnessEval.py
smoothnessEval.py is used to compare the impact of window size on the performance of our algorithm. The corresponding output is recorded in smoothnessEval.png
#### evaluation.py
evaluation.py is where we write our evaluate function.

evaluate(disparity, truth) takes the predicted disparity array and the ground truth disparity as input, it will return a 6 elements tuple: (error 0.25, error 0.5, , error 1, error 2, error 4, rms)
